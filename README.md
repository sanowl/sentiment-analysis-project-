# Sentiment Analysis with PyTorch and Hugging Face IMDB Dataset

This project implements a sentiment analysis model using PyTorch and the IMDB dataset from the Hugging Face datasets library. The model uses an LSTM architecture to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative.

## Features

- Loads the IMDB dataset from the Hugging Face datasets library
- Tokenizes the text data using the BERT tokenizer
- Trains a sentiment analysis model using PyTorch and LSTM
- Evaluates the model's performance on the test set
- Provides a Flask API for sentiment prediction

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Hugging Face Datasets
- Flask
- Flask-CORS
